# v1.0.0 is finally here!

After months of beta testing, we are proud to release Lokus v1.0.

## Key Features

### 🚀 New Sync Engine
We've completely rewritten our sync engine from scratch. It's now faster, more reliable, and fully end-to-end encrypted.

### 🕸️ Interactive Graph View
Visualize your notes like never before. The new graph view is GPU-accelerated and can handle thousands of nodes without breaking a sweat.

### 🎨 Spark Ideas Canvas
An infinite canvas for your thoughts. Drag and drop notes, images, and websites to create mood boards, diagrams, and more.

## Fixes & Improvements
- **Performance**: Opening large vaults is now 3x faster.
- **UI**: Polished the entire interface with a new glassmorphism design.
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed an issue where nested tags weren't rendering correctly.
