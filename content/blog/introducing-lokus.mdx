We are thrilled to announce the public release of **Lokus**, a new kind of note-taking app designed for the way your brain actually works.

## The Problem with Modern Tools

Most modern productivity tools are:
1. **Slow**: They run in the browser and depend on your internet connection.
2. **Locked In**: Your data is trapped in their proprietary formats.
3. **Rigid**: They force you into a specific hierarchy (folders, lists, etc.).

## The Lokus Philosophy

Lokus is different. We believe in:

### 1. Local-First
Your data lives on your device, in plain Markdown files. You own it. Forever.

### 2. Speed as a Feature
Lokus is a native app. It opens instantly, searches instantly, and never shows you a loading spinner.

### 3. Networked Thought
Ideas don't live in isolation. Our **Graph View** and **Backlinks** let you connect thoughts organically, building a web of knowledge that grows with you.

## What's Next?
This is just the beginning. We have a roadmap packed with features like:
- **End-to-End Encrypted Sync** (Available now!)
- **Canvas** for infinite brainstorming
- **Plugin System** for community extensions

Download Lokus today and start building your second brain.
